## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed
2. Email security@termin-bot.com with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
3. We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
4. We will provide updates on the status of the vulnerability

## Security Measures

### 1. Authentication

- Bearer token authentication for API access
- Token rotation and expiration
- Secure token storage
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

### 2. Data Protection

- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- TLS for all API communications
- Secure session management
- Input validation and sanitization

### 3. Access Control

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- API endpoint protection
- Resource-level permissions

### 4. Rate Limiting

- Request rate limiting
- IP-based limiting
- Service-specific limits
- Exponential backoff

### 5. Monitoring and Logging

- Security event logging
- Audit trail maintenance
- Real-time monitoring
- Alert system for suspicious activities

### 6. Dependencies

- Regular dependency updates
- Security scanning
- Vulnerability assessment
- Automated dependency checks

### 7. Code Security

- Static code analysis
- Security-focused code review
- Secure coding guidelines
- Regular security training

## Security Headers

The API implements the following security headers:

```http
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```
