### 4. Application Initialization
- Updated `main.py` to initialize the API client and captcha service at startup
- Added proper shutdown handling for all components
- Added configuration validation at startup

### 5. Parallel Booking Implementation
- Created a new `BookingManager` class to handle parallel booking attempts
- Implemented concurrent booking for multiple available slots to increase booking chances
- Added proper concurrency control with semaphores and locks
- Implemented timeout handling for booking attempts
- Added metrics tracking for parallel booking success/failure rates
- Updated task management system to use the BookingManager
- Added configuration parameters for controlling parallel booking behavior

### 6. Testing Suite Improvements
- Created comprehensive unit tests for the BookingManager class
- Added tests for parallel booking functionality
- Implemented tests for success, failure, and timeout scenarios
- Added tests for concurrency control and rate limiting
- Improved test coverage for critical components

### 7. Notification System Improvements
- Created a new `NotificationManager` class to handle user notifications
- Implemented rich message formatting with HTML and emojis
- Added support for inline buttons with callback data and URLs
- Implemented notification preferences and cooldown periods
- Added support for different notification types (appointment found, booked, failed, reminder)
- Implemented daily digest for batched notifications
- Added metrics tracking for notification success/failure rates

## Next Steps

### Monitoring and Logging Enhancements
- Enhance health monitoring to include API-specific metrics
- Improve structured logging for all components
- Add log correlation IDs for tracking request flows
- Create a metrics dashboard for monitoring

### Security Improvements
- Implement secure storage for API keys and tokens
- Add credential rotation mechanism
- Implement input validation for all user inputs
- Add rate limiting for Telegram bot commands

## Testing

The implemented changes should be tested thoroughly to ensure they work as expected. Here are some key test cases:

1. **API Integration Tests**
   - Test captcha token acquisition and caching
   - Test API requests with and without captcha tokens
   - Test error handling for various API response types

2. **Configuration Tests**
   - Test configuration validation with missing variables
   - Test loading configuration from environment variables

3. **Database Model Tests**
   - Test creating and retrieving WebsiteConfig with captcha fields
   - Test CaptchaVerification model
   - Test ApiRequest model for tracking API requests

4. **Parallel Booking Tests**
   - Test booking multiple slots in parallel
   - Test handling of successful and failed booking attempts
   - Test timeout handling for booking attempts
   - Test concurrency control with semaphores and locks
   - Test metrics tracking for parallel booking

5. **Notification System Tests**
   - Test different notification types and formats
   - Test notification preferences and filtering
   - Test daily digest functionality
   - Test inline button actions
   - Test notification cooldown periods

## Deployment

To deploy the updated application:

1. Update the `.env` file with the required variables
2. Build and start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Monitor the logs to ensure everything is working correctly:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

## Conclusion

The implemented improvements address the most critical issues with the Termin Bot project, particularly around API integration, captcha handling, parallel booking, and notification system. The parallel booking implementation significantly increases the chances of securing appointments by attempting to book multiple slots simultaneously, with proper concurrency control and error handling.

The enhanced notification system provides a better user experience with rich formatting, inline buttons, and customizable preferences. Users can now receive more informative and actionable notifications about their appointment booking status.

These changes should significantly improve the bot's ability to monitor and book appointments from the target website, especially in high-demand scenarios where slots are quickly filled.

The next steps focus on enhancing the monitoring, logging, and security aspects of the application, which will further improve its reliability, usability, and maintainability.
